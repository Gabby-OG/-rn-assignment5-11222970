Project Setup:

Begun my assignment by running a new React Native project using expo init in my command prompt.
Installed necessary dependencies such as react-navigation for navigation and react-native-vector-icons for icons.
Theme Context:

Created a ThemeContext to manage and toggle between light and dark themes.
Defined custom light and dark themes.
Navigation:

Configured a bottom tab navigator using @react-navigation/bottom-tabs.
Created HomeScreen and SettingsScreen components to be used as tabs.
Home Screen:

Designed the HomeScreen to display a header, a debit card component, icons for different actions (Send, Receive, Loan, Top-up), and a list of recent transactions.
Implemented a Header component with a profile picture and a search icon.
Styled the Card component to look like a debit card with card number, cardholder name, expiry date, CVV, and MasterCard logo.
Components:

Created reusable components like Header, Card, and TransactionItem.
Used react-native-vector-icons for icons.
Styling:

Applied consistent styling using StyleSheet.create.
Made use of the theme context to apply theme-specific styles dynamically.
